The drilling equipment used for this purpose includes rock drills, drilling rigs, and blasthole drills.\n2.Excavators and loaders: After the limestone has been broken up, it needs to be removed from the quarry. Excavators and loaders are used to scoop up the broken limestone and transport it to the processing plant.\n3.Crushing and screening equipment: Once the limestone has been transported to the processing plant, it needs to be crushed and screened to produce a variety of different products. Crushers and screens are used for this purpose.\n4.Conveyors: Conveyors are used to transport the crushed and screened limestone from the processing plant to storage bins and loading areas.\n5.Dredging equipment: In some cases, limestone is extracted from underwater quarries using dredging equipment, such as suction dredges and cutter dredges.\n6.Trucks and haulers: Once the limestone has been processed, it is transported to its final destination, such as a construction site or manufacturing plant, using trucks and haulers.";

It does, however, absorb water and, since it is a carbonate rock, it is highly reactive when exposed to acids or even mildly acidic rain water, and it can suffer substantial deterioration. The most common effect of weathering and erosion is loss of precise detail.";
